Vidada Server
=======

Vidada is a video clip manager which supports custom Tags and supports nearly every video format. You can have thousands of movies indexed, and all can be in the thumbnail view.

Also, Vidada does not dictate you any folder structure. Instead, the file contents are indexed (file hashes), which means that you can even move your video clips around in your media library, or you can rename them. Hell, you can keep your files organized the way you have and also change the directory structure anytime. However, by using your folder structure for automated tagging of your media files, you can greatly benefit if you already put some work in your folder structure.

Vidada acts as a media server and streams your media over the network (HTTP/S). The Vidada Server provides a REST API which is used by the web-app and can be used by 3th parties.
