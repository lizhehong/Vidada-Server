Vidada Server
=======

Vidada is a video clip manager which supports custom Tags and supports nearly every video format. You can have thousands of movies indexed, and all can be in the thumbnail view. Vidada has an custom written Thumbnail viewer which has an intelligent just-in-time rendering to support unlimited number of items.

Also, Vidada does not dictate you any folder structure. Instead, the file contents are indexed (file hashes), which means that you can even move your video clips around in your media library, or you can rename them. Hell, you can keep your files organized the way you have and also change the directory structure anytime.

Vidada acts as a media server and stream your media over the network (HTTP). The Vidada Server provides a REST API which is the primary interfaces for both internal applications and 3th parties.
